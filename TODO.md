[x] Use daisy toast elements for UI notifications
[x] When posting contribution (either with API or UI), if the vehicle already exists, prevent creation of it (and don't count credit usage). In the response, we may propose the user to create a variant of the vehicle instead.
[x] While reviewing a proposal I am the author of, I would expect to be able to cancel it. This shouldn't be available from the moderator or admin role, instead they just can decline the proposal.
[x] From the vehicle list, if there are multiple proposal, I would like to be able to click on the pill and get redirected to the modal that allow me to review the proposals (that exists already).
[x] Likewise for the variants, I would like to see all the update proposal and to be able to click on the pill and get redirected to the modal that allow me to review the proposals (that modal exists already).
[x] When running in dev mode, when admin, I would like to have a button to wipe all the vehicles. The same for proposals.
[x] Unify the UI/UX, buttons, fields, vertical / horizontal alignment, grid components features.
